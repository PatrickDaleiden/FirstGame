First Attempt at Developing a Game
This was my actual first attempt at coding in Javascript.  I felt that the best way to learn a new language was to try to make something I found fun, a video game.  What I tried to do for this project was make a point and click shooter.  I created a basic template for the enemies, the shooter, and the bullets.  On top of that I calculated where the mouse was on the canvas and based on that, on click, a bullet would fire at the location of your mouse.  The reason I stopped working on this game was because I was trying to do everything in one file because I didn't know how to put in other scripts.  Now that I know how to, 3 years later, I will probably go back and try to fix this game up.


//Everything I wrote is mine except the Firecaster logo and the canvas because I didn't know HTML at the time.
